# match-outcome-predictor
Use ML techniques to predict score outcomes of football matches

## Project Description

The aim of this football match outcome prediction project is to create a pipeline to systematically clean and perform feature engineering on football matches data samples and upsert the data into a database. ML models will then be trained on this data to predict match outcomes.

## Technologies Used

To accomplish this I have used pandas and sklearn.
